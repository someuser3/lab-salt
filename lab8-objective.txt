Slightly midified lab 8 objectives:

1. Create a script that runs the firewall script, waits 30 seconds and then puts the old (safe) rules back (see bin/restartfirewall.sh)
2. Create a firewall script that creates rules to allow the following services to answer requests from the outside: ssh, salt, dns, web, samba (see bin/firewall.sh)
3. Save the output of iptables-save as /root/labs/lab8a.txt (also saved as salt/files/os/centos7/iptables-file)
4. Create a salt state that ensures iptables is installed, the service is running, and salt/files/os/centos7/iptables-file is provisioned as /etc/syconfig/iptables (see salt/packages/iptables.sls)
5. Create a salt state that ensures that selinux is enforcing and the polyinstantiation_enable boolean is set to on (see salt/packages/selinux.sls)
7. Save the output of getsebool -a | grep polyinstantiation > /root/lab/lab8b.txt

Submit output of steps 3, 4, 5, and 6.
